          This page should enable users to keep up with the latest developments in the jazz world, with special emphasis on the local (Oxfordshire) scene, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether this works or not depends on YOU - we want to hear about new clubs or venues opening (or closing); about last-minute gigs which didn't make it into the current JazzFinder; about the emergence of new bands or the demise of old ones; about musicians changing allegiance or hanging up their instruments or, sadly, shuffling off this mortal coil - anything and everything that you think may be of interest to our users.
