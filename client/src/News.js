          With the imposition of total lockdown, all events listed in JazzFinder are cancelled.  It's impossible to say at this stage when those gigs which normally take place on a regular basis will resume - the most optimistic estimate seems to be the end of May - but some events have been rescheduled, as shown below.

          This page should enable users to keep up with the latest developments in the jazz world, with special emphasis on the local (Oxfordshire) scene, of course.

          Whether this works or not depends on YOU - we want to hear about new clubs or venues opening (or closing); about last-minute gigs which didn't make it into the current JazzFinder; about the emergence of new bands or the demise of old ones; about musicians changing allegiance or hanging up their instruments or, sadly, shuffling off this mortal coil - anything and everything that you think may be of interest to our users.
